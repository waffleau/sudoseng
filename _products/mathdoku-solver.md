Mathdoku (a.k.a KenKen) puzzles are closely related to Sudoku puzzles, but provide an extra layer of entertainment
in the form of math 'cages'.

The Mathdoku Solver app is intended to be used with puzzles you find anywhere - in newspapers, magazines, puzzle
books, online, etc. It only takes a minute or two to transfer a 6x6 'paper' puzzle onto the app's grid, and from
there you can use the app for 'hints' (by revealing individual squares of your choice) or as a step-by-step logical
guide. Either way, it can help you figure out how to solve a puzzle without just giving you the answer. It is not
designed for interactively 'playing' Mathdoku puzzles - there are plenty of other apps for that.
