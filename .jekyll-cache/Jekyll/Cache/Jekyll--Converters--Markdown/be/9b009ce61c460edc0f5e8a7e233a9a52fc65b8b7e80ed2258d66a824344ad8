I"Ú<p>Mathdoku (a.k.a KenKen) puzzles are closely related to Sudoku puzzles, but provide an extra layer of entertainment
in the form of math â€˜cagesâ€™.</p>

<p>The Mathdoku Solver app is intended to be used with puzzles you find anywhere - in newspapers, magazines, puzzle
books, online, etc. It only takes a minute or two to transfer a 6x6 â€˜paperâ€™ puzzle onto the appâ€™s grid, and from
there you can use the app for â€˜hintsâ€™ (by revealing individual squares of your choice) or as a step-by-step logical
guide. Either way, it can help you figure out how to solve a puzzle without just giving you the answer. It is not
designed for interactively â€˜playingâ€™ Mathdoku puzzles - there are plenty of other apps for that.</p>
